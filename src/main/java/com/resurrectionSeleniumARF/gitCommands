We have local repo and remote repo

from folder when we create git init => it makes that folder local git repo

git add  => will add files for indexing(consider kind of staging area

git commit -m " your comment" =>will make them ready for push to remote



Now to map this local with remote repo, we will create repo on github
once this repo is created we will link it with local repo

git remote add origin <remote repo.git>   //now linking is done

git push origin master    // copying file from local to remote in master branch


git log // will show log 


now LOCAL==REMOTE

Lets make some change on remote. Lets say add "file1.txt" on remote

now Local not equals remote


git pull origin master   //sync again

now LOCAL==REMOTE

git branch =>shows what branch we are on


git checkout <branchname>  => will change user branch
